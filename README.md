# COMP 163 - Project 2: Character Abilities Showcase

## 🎯 Project Overview

Build a simple character system that demonstrates mastery of object-oriented programming fundamentals: inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism, and composition. This project focuses on core OOP concepts without the complexity of a full game system.

## 📋 Getting Started

1. **Complete your implementation** in `project2_starter.py`
2. **Test your code** by running: `python project2_starter.py`
3. **Run automated tests** with: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
4. **Commit and push** to see GitHub test results

## 🏗️ What You're Building

### **Class Structure (6 Classes Total)**

```
Character (base class)
    ↓
Player (inherits from Character)  
    ↓
Warrior, Mage, Rogue (inherit from Player)

Weapon (composition - separate class)
```

### **Required Stats for Each Class:**

| Class   | Health | Strength | Magic | Special Ability |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Warrior | 120    | 15       | 5     | Power Strike    |
| Mage    | 80     | 8        | 20    | Fireball        |
| Rogue   | 90     | 12       | 10    | Sneak Attack    |

## 🎮 Core Functionality

### **All Characters Must Have:**
- `attack(target)` - Basic attack method
- `take_damage(damage)` - Reduce health
- `display_stats()` - Print character information

### **Players Additionally Have:**
- `character_class` attribute (like "Warrior", "Mage")
- `level` and `experience` attributes
- Enhanced `display_stats()` that shows player info

### **Special Abilities (Each Class):**
- **Warrior**: `power_strike(target)` - High damage attack
- **Mage**: `fireball(target)` - Magic damage attack
- **Rogue**: `sneak_attack(target)` - Critical hit attack

### **Weapons (Composition):**
- `Weapon(name, damage_bonus)` - Characters can HAVE weapons
- `display_info()` - Show weapon information

## ✅ Testing Your Code

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_inheritance.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_method_overriding.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_special_abilities.py -v

# Test your main program
python project2_starter.py
```

### **GitHub Testing**

After pushing your code, check the **Actions** tab to see automated test results:

- ✅ **Inheritance Tests** (20 points) - Class structure and inheritance chain
- ✅ **Method Overriding Tests** (20 points) - Polymorphism and customized methods
- ✅ **Special Abilities Tests** (15 points) - Character abilities and composition

## 🎮 Example Usage

Your program should work like this:

```python
# Create characters (inheritance)
warrior = Warrior("Marcus")
mage = Mage("Aria")  
rogue = Rogue("Shadow")

# Polymorphism - same method, different behavior
for character in [warrior, mage, rogue]:
    character.attack(target)  # Each attacks differently

# Special abilities
warrior.power_strike(enemy)
mage.fireball(enemy)
rogue.sneak_attack(enemy)

# Composition
sword = Weapon("Iron Sword", 15)
sword.display_info()

# Test battle system (provided for you)
battle = SimpleBattle(warrior, mage)
battle.fight()
```

## 🎲 SimpleBattle System (Provided)

You have a **SimpleBattle** class already written that you can use to test your characters:

```python
battle = SimpleBattle(character1, character2)
battle.fight()  # Simulates a simple battle
```

**⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY the SimpleBattle class** - it's provided for testing your implementations.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Protected Files**
- **DO NOT MODIFY** files in the `tests/` directory
- **DO NOT MODIFY** the `SimpleBattle` class
- Modifying protected files will result in automatic academic integrity violation

### **AI Usage Policy**
- ✅ **Allowed**: AI assistance for implementation, debugging, learning
- 📝 **Required**: Document AI usage in code comments
- 🎯 **Must be able to explain**: Every class and method during interview

## 🏆 Grading

- **Inheritance Tests (20%)**: Proper 3-level inheritance chain
- **Method Overriding (20%)**: Polymorphism and customized behaviors
- **Special Abilities (15%)**: Character-specific methods and composition
- **Code Quality (5%)**: Professional comments and documentation
- **Interview (40%)**: Code explanation and live coding

## 🎨 Bonus Creative Elements

Feel free to add your own creative touches for bonus points:
- >> Additional character classes beyond the three required << (I created the alchemist and bard class that use unique methods to call the class and function provided)
- More weapon types with different properties
- Enhanced special abilities with unique effects

## AI Usage
- AI helped me figure out how to use enumerate
- AI helped me used th super().__init__ call
- AI helped me understand the order of operations for class calls
- AI gave me examples of attributes for references

## How to Run
- First, create a character type using Warrior, Rogue, Alchemist, etc.
- Second, display the stats using (character_variable).display_stats
- Third, make a test dummy as a character using character class + required parameters and test it for your character's .attack method
- Fourth, use a target and (character_type).(special_ability) to test power of them
- Fifth, call weapons with the first argument being the weapon name and second being the damage boost, then display using .display.info()
- Sixth, call SimpleBattle class two characters as arguments, then call the .fight() function within it
